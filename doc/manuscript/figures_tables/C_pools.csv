aboveground biomass,all biomass of living vegetation,minimum size censused ,may exclude understory if minor component
,,include non-dicot trees? ,yes
,,include dead standing?,no
,,biomass allometry,Tier 1 defaults draw on a variety of allometric models
belowground biomass,all biomass of live roots ,all factors relevant to aboveground biomass,see above
,,allometry or assumed ratio of below- to above-ground biomass (R),can estimate based on R
,,minimum root diameter,may exclude fine roots; suggested minimum diameter of 2 mm for fine roots
dead wood ,"all non-living woody biomass above a specified diameter, aboveground or belowground",minimum diameter,"10 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
,,include belowground?,yes
litter ,"all non-living biomass smaller than dead wood but larger than soil organic matter, in various states of decomposition both above or within the mineral or organic soil",maximum diameter (= minimum diameter for deadwood),"10 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
,,minimum size (= size limit for soil organic matter),suggested 2 mm
,,layers included,"entire O horizon: litter (OL),  fumic (OF),  and  humic (OH) layers"
,,include belowground? ,yes
soil organic matter ,organic carbon in mineral soils to a specified depth ,sampling depth ,"30 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
