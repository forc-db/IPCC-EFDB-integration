# IPCC-EFDB-integration

Records of forest C stocks, increments, and fluxes in our [Global Forest C database (ForC)](https://forc-db.github.io/) stand to be of value to national greenhouse gas inventories if made available through the Emission Factor Database (EFDB) of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

This repository houses scripts, data records, and documentation of our process for semi-automated submission of data from ForC into the EFDB. 

This project is documented in our [in-press manuscript](https://github.com/forc-db/IPCC-EFDB-integration/blob/main/doc/manuscript/ForC-EFDB-manuscript-for-ESSD.pdf), in which we document the process, assess the data available and submitted to date, and provide recommendations for improving forest data collection, analysis, and reporting to improve inventories of forest-sector greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

The workflow procedure is outlined in [workflow.md](https://github.com/forc-db/IPCC-EFDB-integration/tree/main).
